# Configuration & Tweaks

---

Although the guide has many tweaks and configurations setup for instant play, you can edit many of them these using the below:


### Mod Configuration Menu:
Some mods may have a **Mod Configuration Menu**. When in game > enter the **Pause Menu** > press <span class="custom-text">**'M'**</span> to open up the **Mod Configuration Menu**.

### Stewie's Tweaks:
When in game > enter the **Pause Menu** > go to **Settings** > <span class="custom-text">**Tweaks**</span>. There's a large selection of tweaks to pick from but you will need to restart your game for these to take effect.

### MO2 INI Files:
MEW has many ini files stored in **MEW - INI's and Configs**. Locate the mod > **double click** it > click the <span class="custom-text">**INI Files**</span> tab at the top.
