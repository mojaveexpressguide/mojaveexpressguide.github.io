The Mojave Express Guide is a curated, fully modular **[Viva New Vegas](https://vivanewvegas.moddinglinked.com/)** extension guide that aims to enhance the vanilla gameplay experience whilst keeping your game fairly lore friendly and balanced. This guide has taken inspiration from the **[Wasteland Survival Guide](https://wastelandsurvivalguide.com/)** and my own picks for mods I use in my playthroughs. This guide is **fully compatible** with all **VNV** mods, and I have provided patches, loadorder and LOD to go with. You will **require** a working, stable **Viva New Vegas** setup before you can proceed with the guide! The format for the guide is very similar to VNV and so shouldn't be too hard to follow.

:::tip Note:

This guide will cover a large assortment of mods and in combination with **Viva New Vegas** will be more than enough to enhance your game in all of the key areas. The main complaint about Fallout: New Vegas is its outdated gameplay mechanics and so I've included many of the best elements from FO4 to bring the game up to a 2024 standard.

Below is a brief overview of the key areas enhanced and a couple of the most noticable mods in the guide:

:::

- **User Interface:** The user interface has been substantially enhanced with higher resolution UI and icons, various display modernizations from the newer games, a new layout and visibility tweaks.  


- **Gameplay:** You will now be able to sprint, slow down time, lean and bash your foes. New enemy mechanics have been added.  


- **Overhauls:** Shooting has been revamped with improved accuracy and selective firing. Power armour is reminiscent of FO4 and radiation is deadly!  


- **Content:** NPC's now have new clothing/armours, backpacks and weapons.  


- **Locations:** More detailed landscapes, new interiors and dungeons to explore.  


- **Visuals:** Weapon DOF, Bullet trails, dropped mags and HQ bullet impacts.  


- **Animations:** Smooth animations for weapons, object interactions, movement and staggering.


- **Audio:** Fresh UI, object, footstep and weapon sounds. Additionally some new music + radio songs.
