### WAP B42 Optics Patch

Use this patch if you downloaded the WAP retextures and have B42 Optics.

**Installation:**

- **Main Files - [WAP B42 Optics Patch](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/81731?tab=files)**


### METG - LOD Generation

I highly recommend that you generate your own **Object & Terrain LOD** at this point. You can do so by following this [LOD Guide](https://vivanewvegas.moddinglinked.com/lod.html) but do take note at the below mod first.

### [Parallax series -- Rocks variety](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/84359)![](../static/img/New.png)

Before you do generate your LOD. Once you have downloaded the resources, download this mod and place the files below **Wasted LOD - Cliffs of Mojave**.

**Installation:**

- **Main Files - Parallax series--Rocks variety Meshes No Occlusion**

- **Main Files - Textures Vanilla size and LOD**

:::info Double-click Lod Additions and Improvements in MO2:

Select the **Filetree** tab and find the file `meshes\dlcanch\architecture\tents\dlcanchtentcornerchb.nif` then right click and **Rename** to `dlcanchtentcornerchb_lod.nif`.

```
  📁meshes 
   └📁dlcanch 
     └📁architecture
        └📁tents 
          └📁dlcanchtentcornerchb.nif   ⟵ right click and Rename to "dlcanchtentcornerchb_lod.nif"
```
