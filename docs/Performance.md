# Performance & Optimization

---

It is highly recommended to read the [performance guide](https://performance.moddinglinked.com/falloutnv.html) as this is an in-depth guide on how to fix the game's lackluster performance, display issues and alt-tabbing. Covers topics such as DXVK, framerate limiting, display modes, lag and HDR. 

### FPS Limiting:

It is extremely important that your fps is capped to <span class="custom-text">**120 or less**</span>. At framerates higher than this you can expect some weirdness but more importantly this can cause <span class="custom-text">**crashes!**</span>

### DXVK:

In general, on most modern CPUs you can expect performance improvements by using [DXVK](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/79299). You will need to read the [**DXVK section**](https://performance.moddinglinked.com/falloutnv.html#DXVK) of the performance guide as the install and configuration depends entirely on your hardware.
