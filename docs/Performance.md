# Performance & Optimization

---

It is highly recommended to read the [performance guide](https://performance.moddinglinked.com/falloutnv.html) as this is an in-depth guide on how to fix the game's lackluster performance, display issues and alt-tabbing. Covers topics such as DXVK, framerate limiting, display modes, lag and HDR. 

## FPS Limiting:

It is extremely important that your fps is capped to **120 or less**. At framerates higher than this you can expect some weirdness but more importantly this can cause **crashes!**

## DXVK

In general, on most modern CPU's you can expect performance improvements by using [DXVK](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/79299). You will need to read the [**DXVK section**](https://performance.moddinglinked.com/falloutnv.html#DXVK) of the performance guide as the install and configuration depends entirely on your hardware.


## Disabling performance intensive mods

Some of the mods in the wabbajack can be potentially performance intensive. They will be marked with **Potentially Performance Intensive! Can be safely disabled.** in the Notes section and can be safely disabled.
