# MEG - Post Install

You will now be ready to play the game. There are a variety of tweaks and settings you can customize to personalize your experience. I additionally also have a texture you may want to follow: [METG](</docs/METG - Introduction>).

### Mod Configuration Menu:  

When in game > enter the pause menu and press **"M"** to open up the **Mod Configuration Menu**. Mods that support it will allow you to configure some variables to your liking.
