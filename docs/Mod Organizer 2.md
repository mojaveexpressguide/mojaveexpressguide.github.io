### Launching The Game:

You will need to launch the game through **MO2** everytime you intend to play the game.
- For convenience you can also create a **Shortcut** (right below the **Run** button) so that you won't have to manually open MO2 each time before playing.

### Testing Utilities

1. Once the game has reached the main menu, wait a few seconds and you will see a message box from the **Utilities Checker**. 
    - If any check fails and the comment doesn't help you find a solution, open a support thread in the [Mojave Express Wabbajack](https://discord.gg/SFpZYpAuUz) discord server. 
2. Close the game and disable the **ML Utilities Checker** under the Utilities separator (left pane).
