Close the launcher.
Click the ![INIFilesButton](../static/img/INIFilesButton.webp) button at the top of MO2 and select **INI Editor**.
Select the **FalloutPrefs.ini** tab.
Change the following settings in the **Display** section:

    - **`iSize H`** = your screen height

Close the launcher.


### Launching The Game:

You will need to launch the game through **MO2** everytime you intend to play the game.
- For convenience you can also create a **Shortcut** (right below the **Run** button) so that you won't have to manually open MO2 each time before playing.

### Testing Utilities:

1. Once the game has reached the main menu, wait a few seconds and you will see a message box from the **Utilities Checker**. 
    - If any check fails and the comment doesn't help you find a solution, open a support thread in the [Mojave Express Wabbajack](https://discord.gg/SFpZYpAuUz) discord server. 
2. Close the game and disable the **ML Utilities Checker** under the Utilities separator (left pane).
