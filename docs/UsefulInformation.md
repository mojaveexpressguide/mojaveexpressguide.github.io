- **Perks** and **traits** have been completely overhauled. You will want to look at [Perkout](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/80309?tab=description) before going your usual build.
- Flame weapons now utilize the **Explosives** skill instead of Energy Weapons. See [Burning Desire](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/91581) for more info.
- **Weapon requirements** matter significantly more now! You can expect more sway, slower reloads, lower attack speeds and explosives may fail or explode prematurely. See [Weapon Requirements System](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/69161) for more info.

<p> <span class="custom-text">**These can all be safely disabled in the left pane of MO2 under the Difficulty Overhauls separator. топ**</span> </p>
- (**Food Effect Tweaks**) - Food heals less.
- (**Bad Touch NVSE**) - Fire burns, electricity shocks, cacti poke, and more!
- (**RAD - Overhaul**) - Radiation is actually dangerous, reducing your HP and AP (in hardcore mode) like FO4.
- (**Ghouls Inflict Radiation Damage**) - Ghouls, Centaurs, Spore Carriers, Tunnelers, Mantis, Radroaches, and Molerats inflict radiation damage.
- (**Water Depth Radiation**) - Water radiation is ramped up based upon depth.
- (**Famine**) - Loot is rarer and weapons & armour have lower conditions when found.
- (**Harder Barter Faster Stronger**) - The barter skill matters significantly more for buying and selling prices.
- (**STALKER Barter**) - You can no longer sell weapons & armour under 30% condition.
- (**Simple Harder Credit Check and Passport**) - The strip is slightly more difficult to get into and costs 4000 caps the direct way now.
