- **Perks** and **traits** have been completely overhauled. You will want to look at [Perkout](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/80309?tab=description) before going your usual build.
- Flame weapons now utilize the **Explosives** skill instead of Energy Weapons. See [Burning Desire](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/91581) for more info.
- **Weapon requirements** matter significantly more now! You can expect more sway, slower reloads, lower attack speeds and explosives may fail or explode prematurely. See [Weapon Requirements System](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/69161) for more info.
