## Post-Installation Steps

### Exclusions:

This operation is required because Windows can block MO2 and mod files from loading due to how MO2's virtualized filesystem works.

1. Open <button onClick={() => window.location.href = 'ms-settings:windowsdefender'}> Windows Security </button>
2. Open **Virus & threat protection**.
3. Click **Manage settings** under Virus & threat protection settings.
4. Scroll down and click **Add or remove exclusions** under Exclusions.
5. Add a Folder exclusion and point it to the **Installation Location** folder. 
    - Example: `C:\Modding\MEW`

- If you are using a third-party antivirus, you will need to find the exclusions menu and add one to the same folder.
