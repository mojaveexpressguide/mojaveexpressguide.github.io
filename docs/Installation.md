:::danger Wabbajack is currently not showing on the Wabbajack software!

## Post-Installation Steps

### Exclusions:

This operation is required because Windows can block MO2 and mod files from loading due to how MO2's virtualized filesystem works.


1. Open <button onClick={() => window.location.href = 'ms-settings:windowsdefender'}> Windows Security </button>
2. Open **Virus & threat protection**.
3. Click **Manage settings** under Virus & threat protection settings.
4. Scroll down and click **Add or remove exclusions** under Exclusions.
5. Add a Folder exclusion and point it to the **Installation Location** folder.
    - Example: `C:\Modding\MEW`


- If you are using a third-party antivirus, you will need to find the exclusions menu and add one to the same folder.

### Root Mods:

1. In your **Installation Location**, open the <span class="custom-text">**__Files Requiring Manual Install**</span> folder.
<p>![FilesRequiringManualInstall](../static/img/FilesRequiringManualInstall.webp)</p>
2. Copy **everything** inside to the game's **Root folder**.
<p>![RootModsInstall](../static/img/RootModsInstall.webp)</p>
3. Still in the game's Root folder, double-click on **FNVpatch.exe** to run it.
4. A command prompt window will open and it should say:
    `FalloutNV.exe patched!`
5. Close the command prompt and a file named **FalloutNV_backup.exe** should appear in the same folder.

### Radio Fix:

1. In your **Installation Location**, open the <span class="custom-text">**__Radio Fix**</span> folder.
<p>![RadioFixInstallation](../static/img/RadioFixInstallation.webp)</p>
2. Double-click on **Run This.bat**.
3. A command prompt window will open and start encoding files.
4. Once its finished it will say `Radio Fix has been successfully installed!`

### BSA Decompressor:
Decompresses the vanilla BSA files to reduce loading times and stuttering. Can also fix certain sound effects not playing.

1. In your **Installation Location**, open the <span class="custom-text">**__BSA Decompressor**</span> folder. 
2. Double-click on **FNV BSA Decompressor.exe**.
<p>![BSADecompressorInstallation](../static/img/BSADecompressorInstallation.webp)</p>
3. The Fallout: New Vegas and Decompressed Archives paths should be filled by default (Root folder and Data folder respectively).
        - If they aren't, close the program and re-run your game launcher to generate the required registry key.
5. Click **Decompress**, wait for the process the finish, then exit the program once finished.
