# MEG - Introduction

---

:::caution Important:

You will need at least base **VNV** and to have done so using **MO2**. Although this guide has been made with the full **VNV Extended** modlist and is recommended to get the full experience. If you have used another guide or mod manager support will not be given. A **new save** will be required for this guide!

:::

If you are new to Fallout New Vegas and modding in general, I recommend sticking to just **Viva New Vegas** as this guide will substantially change the game and alter your experience.

Please read the mod pages before downloading any mods to give you an idea of what they do and any tweaks, changes and nuiances you need to account for. The mods in the this guide are **optional** but make sure to read and download the patches that are relevant to you. 

## Glossary

<br />

This guide is not associated with the **Viva New Vegas** authors or anyone else for that matter so please refer to the **[Mojave Express discord](https://discord.gg/6brK3Pb8gR)**. I have tested these mods as much as I can but please let me know of any issues. It is likely that there are going to be some bugs as I can't test everything and no mod or mod combo is gonna be perfect.

## To Start:

Unless stated otherwise every mod should be downloaded with **MO2** using the **Mod Manager Download** button.
