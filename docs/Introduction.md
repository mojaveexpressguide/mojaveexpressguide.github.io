# Introduction

---

The Mojave Express guide is a curated **fully modular** list of mods that add depth and additional elements to **[Viva New Vegas](https://vivanewvegas.moddinglinked.com/)** whilst keeping your game fairly lore friendly and balanced.
This guide has taken inspiration from the **[Wasteland Survival Guide](https://wastelandsurvivalguide.com/)** and my own picks for mods I use in my playthroughs. This guide is fully compatible with all VNV mods, and I have provided patches, loadorder and LOD to go with. You will require a working, stable Viva New Vegas setup before you can proceed with the guide! The format for the guide is very similar to Viva New Vegas and so shouldn't be too hard to follow.

<br />

:::caution Important:

You will need at least base **VNV** and to have done so using **MO2**. Although it is recommended to have most of the mods from **VNV Extended** to get the full experience. If you have used another guide or mod manager support will not be given. 
:::

If you are new to Fallout New Vegas and modding in general, I recommend sticking to just **Viva New Vegas** as this guide will substantially change the game and alter your experience.

Please read the mod pages before downloading any mods to give you an idea of what they do and any tweaks, changes and nuiances you need to account for. The mods in the this guide are **optional** but make sure to read and download the patches that are relevant to you.

This guide is not associated with the **Viva New Vegas** authors or anyone else for that matter so please refer to the **[Mojave Express discord](https://discord.gg/6brK3Pb8gR)**. I have tested these mods as much as I can but please let me know of any issues. It is likely that there are going to be some bugs as I can't test everything and no mod or mod combo is gonna be perfect.

## To Start:

Unless stated otherwise every mod should be downloaded with **MO2** using the **Mod Manager Download** button.
