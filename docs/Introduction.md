# Introduction

---

The Mojave Express Wabbajack **(MEW)** is the reincarnation of my previous Mojave Express Guide **(MEG)** which was a [Viva New Vegas](https://vivanewvegas.moddinglinked.com/index.html) additions guide. This time its a [Wabbajack](https://www.wabbajack.org/) which allows me unrestricted mod choice and gives you a semi-automated mod downloading process (A nexus premium account is needed for fully automated downloading). 

Regardless of your experience with **Fallout: New Vegas** or modding this list could be ideal for you. The goal of **MEW** is to add depth and additional elements, including mechanics from FO4/F76 whilst keeping the game fairly lore friendly and balanced. If you are looking for something more vanilla focused then try out [Viva New Vegas](https://vivanewvegas.moddinglinked.com/index.html).
