# Updating MEW

---

### Updating the modlist

Whenever a new version of the MEW is released you can easily update it by rerunning the Wabbajack.

:::danger Before you update!

Make sure that the update is marked as **Safe Mid-Game** before playing on the same save!

:::

You can update your current installation by following these steps:

1. If you added any mods to the list after installation, add the `[NoDelete]` prefix to their name in the left pane.
2. **Verify files** on Steam or GOG Galaxy.
3. **Reinstall the list** from Wabbajack with the **"Overwrite Installation"** checkbox enabled.
4. Re-run the 4GB Patcher, then optionally run the BSA Decompressor as well ([instructions](/docs/Installation#root-mods)).
