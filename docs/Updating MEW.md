# Updating MEW

---

### Updating the modlist:

Whenever a new version of the MEW is released you can easily update it by re-running the **Wabbajack**.

:::danger Before you update!

Make sure that the update is marked as **Safe Mid-Game** before playing on the same save!

:::

You can update your current installation by following these steps:

1. If you added any mods to the list after installation, add the `[NoDelete]` prefix to their name in the left pane.
2. **Verify files** on Steam or GOG Galaxy.
3. **Reinstall the list** from Wabbajack with the same **Installation Location** as your current install.
4. In your games **Root Folder** re-run the **FNVpatch.exe**
5. You will need to redo the [Radio Fix](/docs/Installation#radio-fix) step again.
6. Then optionally redo the [BSA Decompressor](http://localhost:3000/docs/Installation#bsa-decompressor) step as well.
