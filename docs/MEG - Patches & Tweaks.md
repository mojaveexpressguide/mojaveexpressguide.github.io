# MEG - Patches & Tweaks

---

As you did with **Viva New Vegas** create new separators for the above categories.

### [NV Compatibility Skeleton](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/68776)

A skeleton with compatibility for the latest mods. You would have installed this from VNV in under the Visuals seperator.

:::info On the left pane in MO2:

> Drag **NV Compatibility Skeleton** installed previously from **Viva New Vegas** below the newly created separator. This mod should be as low as possible in your modlist.

### MEG - Navmesh Compatibility Patch

This is a premade **Navmesh Compatibility Patch** for MEG. This requires YUP, AWLOP, NVInteriors, New Vegas Landscape Overhaul Re-Remastered, The Living Desert, Uncut Wasteland, Vanilla Enhancements and Uncut Wasteland - NVInteriors Remastered Patch.

**Installation:**

- **Main Files - [MEG - Navmesh Compatibility Patch](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/80444?tab=files)**

:::tip Note:

If you download this then disable **VNV Extended Navmesh Patch** and **YUP Navmesh Overhaul Patch** if you have them from **VNV**.

If you do not have all of the selected mods or plan to add more please create your own navmesh compatibility patch using the guide on this page: **[Improved AI (Navmesh Overhaul Mod)](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/81003)**

:::


### MEG - LOD Generation

I highly recommend that you generate your own **Object LOD** at this point unless you plan on following **METG** or adding your own textures. You can do so by following this [LOD Guide](https://vivanewvegas.moddinglinked.com/lod.html).
  
If you have downloaded **Viva New Vegas** with **Wabbajack** you will already have the resources listed on that page and so all you need to do is disable the **FNVLODGen Output** mod that you have in **MO2**, then follow the linked [LOD Guide](https://vivanewvegas.moddinglinked.com/lod.html) from the **FNVLODGen** section onwards. When it comes to naming your LOD **Output** just call it **Custom FNVLODGen Output**.

:::tip Note: 

> Alternatively you can download pregenerated LOD which I generated with all of the mods in VNV + MEG using the texture guide. You will still need to download and install the below mods in the order presented!
