# MEG - Patches & Tweaks

---

As you did with **Viva New Vegas** create new separators for the above categories.

### [NV Compatibility Skeleton](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/68776)

A skeleton with compatibility for the latest mods. You would have installed this from VNV in under the Visuals seperator.

:::info On the left pane in MO2:

> Drag **NV Compatibility Skeleton** installed previously from **Viva New Vegas** below the newly created separator. This mod should be as low as possible in your modlist.

### MEG - Navmesh Compatibility Patch

This is a premade **Navmesh Compatibility Patch** for MEG. This requires YUP, AWLOP, NVInteriors, New Vegas Landscape Overhaul Re-Remastered, The Living Desert, Uncut Wasteland, Vanilla Enhancements and Uncut Wasteland - NVInteriors Remastered Patch.

**Installation:**

### MEG - LOD Generation

I highly recommend that you generate your own **Object LOD** at this point unless you plan on following [**METG**](</docs/METG - Introduction>) or adding your own textures, in which can you should generate LOD last after completing these. You can do so by following this [LOD Guide](https://vivanewvegas.moddinglinked.com/lod.html).

:::info Double-click Lod Additions and Improvements in MO2:

Select the **Filetree** tab and find the file `meshes\dlcanch\architecture\tents\dlcanchtentcornerchb.nif` then right click and **Rename** to `dlcanchtentcornerchb_lod.nif`.

```
  üìÅmeshes 
   ‚îîüìÅdlcanch 
     ‚îîüìÅarchitecture
        ‚îîüìÅtents 
          ‚îîüìÅdlcanchtentcornerchb.nif  ‚üµ right click and Rename to "dlcanchtentcornerchb_lod.nif"
```
