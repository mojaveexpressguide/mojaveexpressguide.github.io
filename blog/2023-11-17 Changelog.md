**Mojave Express 3.4 update**

Update to add and remove some shit. I'm not conviced with Character Kit Remake yet.

Reorganised some mods on the website. 

### MEG - User Interface
- **Removed:** Consistent Pip-Boy Icons v5 - Items
- **Removed:** Consistent Pip-Boy Icons v5 - Weapons
- **Removed:** Consistent Pip-Boy Icons v5 - Apparel
- **Removed:** Consistent Pip-Boy Icons v5 - Framework Plugin
- **Removed:** Weapon Hotkey Icons

These mods are perfectly fine but theres so many files for no reason and I don't deem them necessary.
